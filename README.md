# Puppet ENC Using Mongodb

## Documentation

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/bcarpio/mongodb-enc/wiki). 


## Project Status

This project is still in **Alpha**. This means at any given time the code is under active development.
There is still one big change comming where I change the mongodb schema. I currently don't like how I have the mongodb laid out.
If you are using this code and would like to make feature requests please do so in the issue tracker.
